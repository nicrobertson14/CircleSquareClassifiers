# Classifying Circles & Squares

This project contains implementations of several machine learning classification methods including decision trees, kd-trees with k-nearest-neighbours and convolutional neural networks

To build a kd-tree and perform 'k' nearest neighbour search simply run ```python knn.py k``` where k is an integer > 0
